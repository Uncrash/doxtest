What you're going to do is input <strong>Your Name</strong>, and then your <strong>Email Address</strong>, which should match both your email within OneLogin and Office 365. Finally, for Password, you'll be using your OneLogin user password as it will be routing through OneLogin to authenticate the Office credentials.</p>
