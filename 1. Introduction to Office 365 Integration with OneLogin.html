<p>OneLogin's integration with Office 365 lets&nbsp;your employees use OneLogin to sign in once to&nbsp;access all of their&nbsp;Office 365 applications. If you use Active Directory, <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/201173374">OneLogin Desktop SSO</a> uses Integrated Windows Authentication to give your users immediate&nbsp;access to Office 365 and their other OneLogin-managed applications whenever&nbsp;they are logged into their PC or Mac&nbsp;using&nbsp;their Active Directory domain credentials. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Whether or not you use Active Directory, OneLogin provides real-time sync between your directory service and Office 365, and also provides automatic user&nbsp;provisioning&nbsp;of&nbsp;Office 365 licenses without having to manually update&nbsp;each user individually. Use OneLogin to automatically provision license options for Yammer, SharePoint, Microsoft&nbsp;Communications, Exchange, and more.</p>
<p>OneLogin for Office 365 also connects seamlessly into Lyne,&nbsp;Outlook, and&nbsp;mobile mail clients for Windows Mobile,&nbsp;iPhone, Android, and Blackberry.</p>
<h3>Suggested architecture&nbsp;and configurations</h3>
<p>In a&nbsp;OneLogin integration with Office 365,&nbsp;OneLogin provides the single sign-on (SSO) federation service that would otherwise typically be provided by Active Directory Federation Services (ADFS), and the provisioning functionality&nbsp;that would otherwise be provided by Azure Active Directory Sync Service (DirSync).</p>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/onelogin-screenshots/app_specific/o365/o365-adfs-onelogin.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>OneLogin provides many advantages over ADFS, including:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Real-time provisioning of user attributes from Active Directory (or other directory service, including OneLogin itself) to Office 365.</li>
	<li>Entitlement mapping that enables you to assign correct license types automatically to new users when they are created in Office 365.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>However, there are user attributes that OneLogin currently cannot provision from Active Directory to Office 365, including membership in Exchange Server distribution lists. If you store&nbsp;attributes that you need to pass to Office 365 but that OneLogin cannot provision, OneLogin supports DirSync as your provisioning engine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can also remove Active Directory entirely from your configuration, using OneLogin or an alternative third-party directory (such as&nbsp;an OpenLDAP server)&nbsp;as your directory service. While it would seem that Office 365 might require Active Directory integration because Office 365 uses&nbsp;the AD attribute <em>immutableID</em>, OneLogin gets around this requirement by generating&nbsp;a unique user identifier that replaces the&nbsp;<em>immutableID</em> if you use OneLogin as your&nbsp;directory service.</p>
<p>To sum up, OneLogin supports&nbsp;the following federation and provisioning&nbsp;configurations for Office365:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Active Directory</strong> with <strong>OneLogin</strong> for SSO and <strong>OneLogin</strong> for provisioning.</li>
	<li><strong>Active Directory</strong> with <strong>OneLogin</strong> for SSO and <strong>DirSync</strong> for provisioning.</li>
	<li><strong>OneLogin or LDAP</strong> directory, <strong>OneLogin</strong> for SSO, and <strong>OneLogin</strong> for provisioning.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note.</strong> &nbsp;You can use DirSync with a non-AD&nbsp;LDAP directory service, but you must configure&nbsp;that LDAP service to use the <em>immutableID</em> attribute.</p>
